# swiper-migemo
Use ivy/counsel/swiper with migemo.

## Commentary
In the past, many people used avy-migemo to support migemo in swiper, ivy and
counsel. However, avy-migemo has not been maintained for a long time, and
many attempts have been made to achieve migemo support without using
avy-migemo. I decided to write a new minor-mode to make those commands with
ivy-based interface compatible with migemo.
